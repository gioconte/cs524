See my Connectome project at https://github.com/gioconte/Connectome.

### [C. *elegans* Connectome explorer](https://synergenz.github.io/elegans.html)
C. *elegans* is a connectome explorer tool build with d3.js. This tool is still under development, but the authors decide to go for a 2D representation of the human brain's connectome. The graph is displayed using a directed force-layout. 

### Graph Visualization Demo.
[Here](http://ubietylab.net/ubigraph/content/Demos/Carnival.html) some 3D graph animations with a software called **Ubigraph**. This software is using a dynamic, randomized coarsening algorithm. More details about the algorithm can be found [here](http://ubietylab.net/ubigraph/content/Papers/pdf/GraphViz.pdf).


### "Our Brain is the City of Our Mind"
Check this video out. A nice introduction to the Connectome.

### Brain Connectome Visualization for Feature Classification
This poster has been presented in the context of SciVis 2014. Unfortunately only a 30-seconds-video is availabe on the web. Still the goal of this project seems to be very close to my Connectome project. From what it is possible to understand from the video, the visualization is in 2D and they use color coding to visualize edges and some of graph-based metrics like nodal strenght or nodal degree. Here is the video: http://vimeo.com/103347058

### The Neuro Bureau
Look at this very interesting Brain Competition. Scientists and artists are competing to get the best brain visualization declined into different multimedia means. From the most useful to the most abstract brain images are presented and submitted to the competition. More info at http://www.neurobureau.org.

### The x-Toolkit
The x-toolkit is a interesting JavaScript framework based on WebGl. This framework is quite flexible since it allows to load many different standard file formats, specific of neuroimaging area. This framework is a very useful tool for developers, but it is not a ready-to-use application for neuroscientists. A computer scientist team is still needed to obtain the right visualization that could be useful for research. In my opinion, this project is very interesting and it offers the basic building blocks to create a complex and complete visualization. The x-toolkit project could be found at https://github.com/xtk/ .

### Sigma.js
Thanks to Kyle for pointing me to sigma.js library for javascript (http://sigmajs.org). Thanks to this library it will be very easy to display and represent graphs. Integrating both the 3D visualization with the 2D representation of the graph could be a very interesting idea.

### Oculus Rift and Leap Motion
Oculust Rift is an interesting project, but the main limit of this device is the lack of interaction that the user can have with the scene he is looking at. Thanks to the cooperation between Leap Motion and OR the user can interact more effectively with the rendered scene. It is a pretty innovative combination between two young and new projects. More examples at https://www.leapmotion.com/product/vr.
