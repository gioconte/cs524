# Sigma.js
Thanks to Kyle for pointing me to sigma.js library for javascript (http://sigmajs.org). Thanks to this library it will be very easy to display and represent graphs. Integrating both the 3D visualization with the 2D representation of the graph could be a very interesting idea. 

# Oculus Rift and Leap Motion
Oculust Rift is an interesting project, but the main limit of this device is the lack of interaction that the user can have with the scene he is looking at. Thanks to the cooperation between Leap Motion and OR the user can interact more effectively with the rendered scene. It is a pretty innovative combination between two young and new projects.
