### The x-Toolkit
The x-toolkit is a interesting JavaScript framework based on WebGl. This framework is quite flexible since it allows to load many different standard file formats, specific of neuroimaging area. This framework is a very useful tool for developers, but it is not a ready-to-use application for neuroscientists. A computer scientist team is still needed to obtain the right visualization that could be useful for research. In my opinion, this project is very interesting and it offers the basic building blocks to create a complex and complete visualization. The x-toolkit project could be found at https://github.com/xtk/ .

### Sigma.js
Thanks to Kyle for pointing me to sigma.js library for javascript (http://sigmajs.org). Thanks to this library it will be very easy to display and represent graphs. Integrating both the 3D visualization with the 2D representation of the graph could be a very interesting idea. 

### Oculus Rift and Leap Motion
Oculust Rift is an interesting project, but the main limit of this device is the lack of interaction that the user can have with the scene he is looking at. Thanks to the cooperation between Leap Motion and OR the user can interact more effectively with the rendered scene. It is a pretty innovative combination between two young and new projects.
