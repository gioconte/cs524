##Goals
1.	Identify connections and their weight. Being able to easily compare them.
2.	Identify structural patterns in the intrinsic geometry.
3.	Identify the effects of virtual injuries
4.	Identify the absolute importance of given brain regions.
5.	Compare different data reduction techniques on the same dataset
6.	Inspecting each dimension of the multi-dimensional dataset, such as the one about connectome
7.	


##Hypothesis
1.	Using different levels of transparency to highlight different weights is the right dimension and it is better than other techniques (width, colors).


##Tests
1.	Accuracy test. Given a set of edges ask the user to compare their weight and see which is the accuracy achieved, namely how many times the user identify the most/least weighted edge.
