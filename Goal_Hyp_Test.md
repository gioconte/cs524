##Goals
1.	Identify connections and their weight. Being able to easily compare them.
2.	


##Hypothesis
1.	Using different levels of transparency to highlight different weights is the right dimension and it is better than other techniques (width, colors).


##Tests
1.	Accuracy test. Given a set of edges ask the user to compare them and see which is the accuracy achieved, namely how many times the user identify the most/least weighted edge.
