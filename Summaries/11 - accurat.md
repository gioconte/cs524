#[The Architecture of a Data Visualization](https://medium.com/accurat-studio/the-architecture-of-a-data-visualization-470b807799b4 "article")

Accurat is an Italian company working in the frame of data visualization. This article describes and analyzes the design method usually followed to create a new visualization. The company is working on both static visualization, such us the one printed in newspapers, as well as dynamic and more interactive ones. There are some key points that must be clear when designing a new visualization tool or a static representation of a dataset. Let's see them more in details.

##Story telling
Representing data could be compared to a story and to narrow the goal of the visualization it is very important to choose and pursue a topic which is considered interesting for the dataset we are exploring. Once this aspects are defined, they analyze and compare different datasets to understand the central story. Then, secondary tales and less central stories can be related to the main one to enrich all the representation. Here we can introduce the second aspect of data visualization: multi-layering.

##Multi-layering
A data representation should no be flat, so visualization designer should provide different layers through which the user can go and explore the different dimensions are present in a given dataset. Minor tales or stories should be represented. With the presence of multi-layers, they addressed this way of representing data as "non-linear storytelling". In fact, user can focus on the main story as well as dive into more specific details and then go back easily to the main one. 

##Visual encoding
In the "non-linear storytelling" approach, visual encoding is extremely important. In fact, it is very important that the layered structure is clear enough so that the user can identify both the main story and the minor tales. To achieve this critical goal, the author suggests many steps to go through during the design and developing phase:

1.	Create a main architecture of the visualization: create the main map in which you would like to locate all the elements of the main story.
2.	Build shaped elements of dimensionality and form: bind shape and form to quantitative and qualitative parameters as well as bind colors in order to allow categorizations.
3.	Highlight internal relationships.
4.	Add labels and identifiers.
5.	Add minor details to contextualize in a wider world the visualization.
6.	Provide small legends and short descriptions to make general public familiar with the overall visualization and to assist them in the data explorations.
7.	Fine-tuning phase. Ensure that all the layers pop out correctly and the importance according to the hierarchy designed is reflected in the data representation.
